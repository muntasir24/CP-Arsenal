##   1LL << x Examples 

- When you left-shift 1LL by x bits, it moves the 1 to the left by 𝑥 positions.

              example with decimal value of 1-> 000001
    
1. 1LL << 1:
- Binary: 00000010
- Decimal: 2  ( which is 2<sup>1</sup> )

2. 1LL << 2:
- Binary: 00000100
- Decimal: 4  ( which is 2<sup>2</sup> )

2. 1LL << 2:
- Binary: 00000100
- Decimal: 8  ( which is 2<sup>2</sup> )

                       Indicates 2's power
